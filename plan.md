## 1\. High-Level System Architecture

'Kade Connect' is built on a modern, **event-driven microservices architecture**. This design ensures scalability, resilience, and allows for independent development and deployment of different components, including each AI agent.

**Conceptual Flow:**

```

*A text-based representation of the flow would be: Clients interact exclusively through the **API Gateway**. The gateway routes requests to specific backend microservices. These services communicate with each other asynchronously via a **Message Queue** to remain decoupled and handle tasks like data ingestion without blocking the user. AI Agents are specialized services that listen for events or are called by other services to perform their intelligent tasks.*

## 2\. Detailed Component Breakdown & Tech Stack

This section details each component's role and the recommended technologies, including low-code options for rapid development.

### **A. Frontend**

  * **Component:** Single Mobile Application.
  * **Description:** A cross-platform app built using React Native. It will contain logic to switch between the 'Consumer Mode' and 'Partner Mode' based on user role.
  * **Key Features (Consumer):** Conversational AI interface (voice & text), list creation via OCR, virtual pantry management, real-time map of local vendors, order tracking.
  * **Key Features (Partner):** Simple product/price update form (for vendors), camera interface for image submission with GPS tagging (for scouts), earnings dashboard.
  * **Technology Stack:**
      * **Language/Framework:** JavaScript/TypeScript, **React Native**.
      * **State Management:** Redux Toolkit.
      * **API Communication:** Axios.
      * **Camera/OCR:** React Native Vision Camera, with client-side OCR for list scanning.

### **B. Backend (Microservices)**

  * **Description:** A collection of independent services built primarily in Python, communicating via REST APIs and a message queue.
  * **Technology Stack:**
      * **Language/Framework:** **Python 3.11+** with **FastAPI** (for high performance and automatic API documentation).
      * **Containerization:** **Docker**.
      * **Orchestration:** **Kubernetes** or a simpler PaaS like **AWS App Runner**.
      * **Low-Code Backend Alternative:** **Supabase**. It provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, object storage, and auto-generated RESTful APIs out-of-the-box, which can dramatically speed up initial development.

### **C. Data & Messaging Layer**

  * **Description:** The persistence and communication backbone of the system.
  * **Technology Stack:**
      * **Primary Database:** **PostgreSQL** on **AWS RDS**. We will use the **pgvector** extension to turn our primary database into a powerful vector database for AI-driven semantic search and personalization.
      * **Caching:** **Redis** on **AWS ElastiCache** to cache frequently accessed data like promotions, popular product prices, and user sessions.
      * **Messaging:** **RabbitMQ** (or **AWS SQS** for a managed alternative) to handle asynchronous tasks like processing scout submissions.
      * **Object Storage:** **AWS S3** to store images uploaded by 'Kade Scouts'.

### **D. Low-Code Automation & Integration**

  * **Description:** A workflow automation platform to handle repetitive tasks and integrations without writing custom code, perfect for a fast-moving project.
  * **Technology:** **n8n.io** (self-hosted for flexibility) or Zapier.
  * **Use Case Example:** The `Data Acquisition Agent` can be simplified. Instead of writing a service that listens for S3 uploads, an n8n workflow can be triggered by a new image in the S3 bucket. This workflow can then call the Google Vision API for OCR and push the structured data directly into the RabbitMQ queue.

## 3\. Data Pipeline & Communication Flows

Hereâ€™s how data moves through the system for key operations.

### **Flow 1: The 'Kade Scout' Data Ingestion Pipeline**

1.  **Submission (Frontend):** A Scout in 'Partner Mode' takes a picture of a product's price tag. The React Native app captures the image and the device's current **GPS coordinates**.
2.  **Upload:** The app sends the image and GPS data to a secure endpoint on the **API Gateway**.
3.  **Storage & Event Trigger:** The Gateway routes this to a service that uploads the image to the **AWS S3 bucket**. The S3 bucket is configured to automatically trigger an **n8n workflow** (or a Lambda function) upon a new object creation.
4.  **AI-Powered Extraction (n8n Workflow):**
      * The n8n workflow receives the image path.
      * It calls the **Google Vision API** to perform OCR on the image, extracting all text.
      * It uses a simple AI prompt (or regex) to identify the product name and price from the extracted text.
5.  **Publishing:** The workflow formats the result into a standardized JSON object (e.g., `{ "product_name": "Anchor Milk Powder 400g", "price": 1250.00, "location": "lat,lon", "timestamp": "..." }`) and publishes it as a message to a **RabbitMQ** queue named `scout_data_ingestion`.
6.  **Consumption & Storage (Backend):** The `Inventory Service` is subscribed to this queue. It consumes the message, standardizes the product name against the `Product Catalog Service`, and **upserts** (updates or inserts) the price and availability into the **PostgreSQL** database. The latest price is also updated in the **Redis cache** for fast access.

### **Flow 2: Consumer's Shopping Plan Optimization**

1.  **Request (Frontend):** A user in 'Consumer Mode' finalizes their shopping list and taps "Optimize My Cart". The list of product IDs and their `user_id` is sent to the **API Gateway**.
2.  **Orchestration (Backend):** The gateway routes the request to the `Budget Optimization Agent` service.
3.  **Multi-Agent Data Gathering:**
      * The `Budget Optimization Agent` queries the `Inventory Service` to get all available prices for the requested products from *all* vendors (supermarkets and local 'kades').
      * It calls the `Personalization Agent` with the `user_id` to get user preferences (e.g., "prefers organic," brand affinities).
      * It queries the `Loyalty Rules Engine` to get a list of all active promotions and bank offers applicable to the items and vendors.
      * It calls the `Geo-Location Service` to get the distances and potential delivery zones for the vendors relative to the user's address.
4.  **Core Optimization (AI Agent):** The agent constructs a complex cost-function that weighs price, delivery fees, applicability of discounts, and user preferences. It runs an optimization algorithm to find the single or multi-vendor combination that provides the maximum value.
5.  **Hybrid Plan Generation (AI Agent):** The `Logistics Agent` module analyzes the optimized plan to suggest hybrid fulfillment options (e.g., part-delivery, part-pickup).
6.  **Response:** The final, detailed shopping plan(s) are sent back through the API Gateway to the user's mobile app, displaying the breakdown of costs, savings, and fulfillment steps.

## 4\. Development Lifecycle & Versioning

  * **Version Control:** **Git**. We will use the **GitFlow branching model** (`main`, `develop`, feature branches like `feature/user-auth`). This is a standard, robust workflow.
  * **Repository:** **GitHub**. We will use a monorepo structure, with separate directories for each microservice and the frontend app.
  * **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** **GitHub Actions**. Workflows will be set up to automatically:
      * Run tests on every push to a feature branch.
      * Build a Docker container when a feature is merged into `develop`.
      * Deploy the container to a staging environment.
      * Deploy to production when a release is tagged from `main`.
